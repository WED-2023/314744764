I chose to make the size about an old character called the Ice King/Simon Petrikov from the show "Adventure Time". 
I downloaded and used a font fromt the show itself - it's included in the repository files inside the fonts folder.
The colors in the website are taken from characters from the show - mostly from the Ice King himself.
