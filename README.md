I chose to make the site about an older fictional character called the Ice King/Simon Petrikov from the show "Adventure Time". 
I downloaded and used a font from the show itself - it's included in the repository files inside the fonts folder.
The colors in the menu are taken from characters from the show - mostly from the Ice King himself.
There are text descriptions that appear under the photos when you hover over them.
I added an image behind the video to make it seem as if it's playing from the screen of bmo - a character from the show.
I prevented the user from "sending an email" without filling all the fields.
The email form can be hidden and revealed by clicking the "contact me" button.
